Background
----------

I graduated from Tsinghua in 2016 (BSc), and HKU in 2020 (PhD). `Dr. Zhang Zhiwen <http://hub.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp02087>`_ is my PhD supervisor. Title of my PhD thesis is *Robust Lagrangian Numerical Schemes in Computing Effective Diffusivities for Chaotic and Random Flows*. The draft can be downloaded :download:`here <resources/thesis.pdf>`.


Interests
---------

Applied analysis and computational methods for physics and engineering problems, currently including but not limited to,

* structure preserving algorithms: Lagrangian approach for effective diffusivities, KPP front wave speed; scattering in topological insulators.

* data-driven reduced order models: conditional density function in filtering, uniform accuracy schemes in time integration, inverse problems.

* neuron net models: generative models, mesh free approximation to physics problems. 

**I am currently excited about**

* computation of Wasserstein distance,

* assymetric transport in TI,

* surrogate models for particle simulation,

* math foundation of diffusion models,

* effective diffusivities, KPP front speed, chemotaxis,

* interacting particle methods,

* convection Enhanced phenomenon in large Peclet regime,

* DeepRitz,

* POD/Tensor-Train,

* non-linear filtering,

* ...
