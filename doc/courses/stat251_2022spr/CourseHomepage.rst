Questions
+++++++++

We aim to reply to all questions within 24 hours.

* For any questions about the material or HW or exams (aside from regrade requests), please contact us through thediscussion boards on `Ed Discussion <https://edstem.org/us/courses/21023/discussion/>`_.

  * You can write a public post if appropriate (e.g., questions about material, clarification on HW, questions to help understand a midterm problem after the exam has been graded, etc). Note that you can choose to post anonymously but your name will still be visible to the instructor/TAs.

  * Alternatively, you can write a private post, visible only to the instructor/TAs (e.g., if you need help on a HW problem but posting your question would reveal too much of your work).

* For any questions about your graded HW or exams, please submit a regrade request on Gradescope.
* For other questions such as enrollment, prerequisites, accommodations, makeup times for exams, etc, please contact the instructor by email.

Homework
++++++++

There will be weekly written homeworks due Monday at 1:30pm.

* Homework should be submitted on `Gradescope <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/378458>`_
* The lowest homework score will be dropped to accommodate illness and other unforeseen circumstances. **Late homework will not be accepted.**
* HW 8 will count for double weight, and only the first or second half of HW 8 may be dropped.
* For each problem, Gradescope will prompt you to tag the pages containing your answer to that problem. Be sure to tag all the pages that contain any part of your answer---for example if for problem 1, your written explanation is on page 1 and on half of page 2, you will need to tag both of these pages for problem 1.
* It is fine to have multiple problems on the same page (be sure to tag that page for all problems it contains).
* To submit via Gradescope, you will need to upload a single PDF file. If photographing/scanning handwritten work via smartphone, we recommend the free CamScanner or Dropbox apps to produce a single PDF file containing all pages.


Exams
+++++

There will be a midterm exam and a cumulative final exam according to the following schedule.

* Midterm: Monday, April 25 during class
* Final Examination: Scheduled by the registrar

The use of notes, textbooks, or electronic devices will not be allowed during exams. No make-up exams
will be offered without a letter from the dean or a doctor's note. No make-ups are possible for the final exam.

Grading
+++++++
The final course grade will be determined according to the following formula:

* (20% Homework) + max{(40% Final)+(40% Midterm) , (50% Final)+(30% Midterm)}.



Academic Integrity
++++++++++++++++++

You are strongly encouraged to work together on problem sets, but you **must list all of your collaborators on the top of your homework**. Using the ideas of another student without proper acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism, according to the Universityâ€™s academic integrity policy.

**All exams must be completed on your own - collaboration is prohibited.** In general, you must carefully read and follow all of the exam rules. Any student found to have cheated in any way on any exam will receive a failing grade in the course and will be reported to the Dean.
