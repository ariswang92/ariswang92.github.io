Office hours: Mon 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM @ Jones Laboratory 308 . You are not required to attend any office hours, as information that affects generally will discuss during the following lecture. Extra hours may be available given urgent necessity. I might be in my office (309) when there is no one present at 308. To access Jones, you may walk inside Kent Chem Lab on ground floor westwards until a corridor to Jones. 

Note: 

Overview and prerequisites
--------------------------

This is the third in a sequence of mathematics courses for physical sciences majors. It covers differential equations: first and second order ODE, systems of ODE, damped oscillators and resonance, Fourier series and Fourier transforms, Laplace transforms, and solutions of the heat and wave equations.

In order to register for this course you must have taken Math 18300 or ((Math 15300 or 13300 or 16300 or 16310) and (Math 19620 or Math 20250 or Stat 24300))

Course Policies
---------------

Problem Sets
++++++++++++

One problem set will be assigned at the start of each week, remind me if you cannot find it **after Monday**. It will be due at 11:59 pm on the Thursday of next week after it is assigned (unless otherwise specified). You can submit your solutions electronically through Canvas. Canvas is strict about deadlines, so finish early!

Extra practice problems can be found in the textbook. The best way to learn math is to solve lots of problems!

Exams
+++++

**Two Midterms** There will be two midterms on Friday of Fourth and Seventh week that covers materials up to end of Third and Sixth week.

**Final Exam.** It is the policy of the Department of Mathematics that the following rules apply to final exams in all undergraduate mathematics courses:

* Synchronous final exams must occur at the time designated on the College Final Exam Schedule.
* No final examinations may be given during the ninth week of the quarter, except in the case of graduating seniors.
* Instructors are not permitted to excuse students from the scheduled time of the final exam except in the case of an Incomplete.

Incomplete grades will not be assigned except in very rare and extreme circumstances. Final exam covers all materials throught the course.

Grading
+++++++

Your numerical grades will be calculated as follows:

*Problems sets (15%)* + *Midterm I (25%)* + *Midterm II (25%)* + *Final (35%)*

Academic Integrity
++++++++++++++++++

You are strongly encouraged to work together on problem sets, but you **must list all of your collaborators on the top of your homework**. Using the ideas of another student without proper acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism, according to the Universityâ€™s academic integrity policy.

**All exams must be completed on your own - collaboration is prohibited.** In general, you must carefully read and follow all of the exam rules. Any student found to have cheated in any way on any exam will receive a failing grade in the course and will be reported to the Dean.
