* I am an amateur in playing soccer. I used to play for - math department in Tsinghua; Lapchee college, post graduate students association, Chinese students club in the University of Hong Kong; Chinese students club in the University of Chicago; various social team like, 2CFC, Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park Club in Hong Kong and Chinatown Club in Chicago; NTU Staff Team in Singapore.

* In the US, I like doing road trips, especially in the old-fashioned way. Most of my trips are related to hiking in the west. I hike near Chicago during weekends. Now moving to Singapore, I am open to finding a new group.

* I also started to spend some time on kayak, windsurfing and road bikes.
