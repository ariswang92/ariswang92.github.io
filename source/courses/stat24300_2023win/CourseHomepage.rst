Extra hours may be available given urgent necessity. I might be in my office (309) when there is no one present at 308. 

Overview
--------

**Objective:** This course is devoted to the basic theory of linear algebra and its significant applications in scientific computing. The objective is to provide fluency in the subject. Students should leave the course ready to tackle multivariate problems that arise across the sciences.

**Topics:** Gaussian elimination, vector spaces, linear transformations, fundamental subspaces, orthogonality and projections, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, diagonalization, the spectral theorem, and matrix decompositions (QR, Eigenvalue, and Singular Value Decompositions). Systematic methods applicable in high dimensions and techniques commonly used in scientific computing are emphasized.

**Coding:**
Linear algebra is best learned through practice. Suggested programming languages include *NumPy* and *Matlab*. Matlab code examples can be found of the textbook. Please make sure you have a working version of `Matlab <https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/university-of-chicago-719588.html>`_ downloaded on your personal laptop.



Course Policies
---------------

Grading
+++++++

**The final course grade** will be determined according to the maximum of the two following computations:

* (50% Assignments) + (50% Final)
* (70% Assignments) + (30% Final)

*Letter grades* will be assigned using the standard scale, i.e. 90% and up is an A, 85-90% is an A-, 5% interval for each subsequent letter grade. 

The right to *curve* letter grades is reserved. Curved grades will always improve a letter grade. I will never curve a grade down. If you face extenuating circumstances and are concerned about your grade it is your responsibility to inform me as soon as possible. Unjustified requests to change grades at the last minute will not be accepted. 

Assignments
+++++++++++

Assignments will be posted weekly on Monday and due two weeks later. You do not need to tex them out.

* Homework should be submitted on `Gradescope <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/480462>`_
* The lowest homework score will be dropped to accommodate illness and other unforeseen circumstances. **Late homework will not be accepted.**
* For each problem, Gradescope will prompt you to tag the pages containing your answer to that problem. Be sure to tag all the pages that contain any part of your answer---for example if for problem 1, your written explanation is on page 1 and on half of page 2, you will need to tag both of these pages for problem 1.
* It is fine to have multiple problems on the same page (be sure to tag that page for all problems it contains).
* To submit via Gradescope, you will need to upload a single PDF file. If photographing/scanning handwritten work via smartphone, we recommend the free CamScanner or Dropbox apps to produce a single PDF file containing all pages.

Final
+++++

There will be one final during the exam week. The schedule and policy will be announced later.


Academic Integrity
++++++++++++++++++

You are strongly encouraged to work together on assignments, but you **must list all of your collaborators on the top of your submission**. Using the ideas of another student without proper acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism, according to the University’s academic integrity policy.

**All exams must be completed on your own - collaboration is prohibited.** In general, you must carefully read and follow all of the exam rules. Any student found to have cheated in any way on any exam will receive a failing grade in the course and will be reported to the Dean.

Accommodations
++++++++++++++

The University of Chicago is committed to ensuring equitable access to our academic programs and services. Students with disabilities who have been approved for the use of academic accommodations by Student Disability Services (SDS) and need a reasonable accommodation(s) to participate fully in this course should follow the procedures established by SDS for using accommodations. Timely notifications are required in order to ensure that your accommodations can be implemented. Please meet with me to discuss your access needs in this class after you have completed the SDS procedures for requesting accommodations:

* Phone: (773) 702-6000
* Email: disabilities@uchicago.edu
